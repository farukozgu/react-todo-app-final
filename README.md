* **Component Architecture:** Designed with clean, modular components (TaskItem, TaskList) for high maintainability.
* **User Experience (UX):** Includes form validation, dynamic checkbox completion, date display, and Dark Mode theming (implemented via standard styling).
* **Design:** Styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a fully responsive and modern look across all devices.
